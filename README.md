# Plant-species-dataset-visualiztion-Project
This Excel project is based on a dataset of different plant species, showing their names, families, and other details. We used Excel tools like sorting, filtering, pivot tables, and charts to explore and understand the data better. The project helps to identify patterns in plant categories and compare different species easily.
